Android application.

About
-----

This app is built during the free time of the developer for fun. It also tries to ease the task of 
everyday shopping planning, which is a particularly extremely high complexity problem for 
a typical software developer ;) This app would not work and feel the same way if it weren't for 
some great Android open-source projects that were used during the development.
