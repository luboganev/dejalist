<h2>Dejalist - Shopping lists made easy!</h2>
</p>

<h4>About the app</h4>
Dejalist can help you plan easily your daily shopping lists by simply reviewing pictures of your favorite products. 
Typing product names every time is tedious, time consuming and does not utilize the rich media capabilities of our smart devices.
Dejalist will help you take a picture of a product, give it a name and categorize it just once. Building a shopping lists is then just a couple of clicks away. 

<h4>This project is open source!</h4>
This app is built during the free time of the developer for fun. It also tries to ease the task of everyday shopping planning, which is a particularly extremely high complexity problem for a typical software developer ;) If you are interested in the app's internals, just check the project's <a href="https://github.com/luboganev/dejalist/">GitHub page</a>.
